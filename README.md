# Simple glTF sample with Grimoire.js

This is the simplest sample to show glTF model with Grimoire.js.

We haven't prepared enough English samples or documentation yet. Most of documentation is written in Japanese currently.
However, it will be translated in English soon.(Maybe in 1.5 months.)

To know how to display glTF files with Grimoire.js, please see the source codes.
(Tired to read someones code? Don't worry this sample only contains 2 source files.)

## What is Grimoire.js?

Grimoire.js is "WebGL framework for Web development".
Our library would parse GOML to constructing WebGL canvas like HTML.
DOM interfaces are influenced by jQuery, and component interfaces are influenced by Unity.

So, this framework helps Web engineers and 3DCG developer divide their work to make WebGL contents with their favorite rule and theory.

For more detail, please see [main repository](https://github.com/GrimoireGL/GrimoireJS) and [Official site(Currently japanese only)](https://grimoire.gl).
